# Hi, I'm Gustavo Avide! 👋

I am a passionate Software Engineer, that likes a lot taking products from scratch, and for that, it means creating maintainable products. 
If we talk more, I always like to handle data and do some nice structure either to send to the client or send to the frontend,
But my LOVE ❤️, always lies in creating and showing the architecture 🤓.
