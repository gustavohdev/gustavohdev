# Hi, I'm Gustavo Avide! 👋

A passionate Software Engineer inclined towards building products from the ground up, focusing on creating maintainable and scalable solutions.
I thrive on handling data—whether it's structuring it for backend services or presenting it to the frontend.  
There's also a _growing love_ into creating and showcasing an architecture.
