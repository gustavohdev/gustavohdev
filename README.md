# Hi, I'm Gustavo Avide! 👋

I’m a passionate Software Engineer inclined towards building products from the ground up, focusing on creating maintainable, scalable solutions.
I thrive on handling data—whether it's structuring it for backend services or presenting it to the frontend.
But my ❤️ always lies in creating and showcasing an architecture.
